HISTORY OF JS:

1995 : The very first version of JS. It was called Mocha, but already had many fundamental features of modern JS.

1996: Mocha changes to LiveScript and then to JS in order to attract Java developers. JS has nothing to do with Java.

1997: To standardize the language, ECMA releases ECMAScript1(ES1), the first official standard for JS.

2009: ES5 is released with lots of new great features.

2015: ES6/ECMAScript 2015 was released as the biggest update to the language ever.

2016 - ……. continues

To use Modern JS today:

During dev : Use the latest google chrome !

During the Production: Use Babel to transpile and polyfill your code(converting back to ES5 to ensure browser compatability to all users)
